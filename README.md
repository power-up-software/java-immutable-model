# java-immutable-model

Provides a set of classes that allow for the creation of immutable model definitions. It uses the builder pattern to
create the immutable objects.

It also includes a set of common validators. These are used to ensure that the content of the immutable object builders
are valid before constructing the model object. 
This will ensure that only valid immutable objects are generated, reducing the amount of content checking required for the object.

Sample of model objects can be found in the project's sample directory.
